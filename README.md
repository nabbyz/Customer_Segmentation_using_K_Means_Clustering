# Customer_Segmentation_using_K_Means_Clustering
Project Title: Customer Segmentation Analysis

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to segment customers into different groups based on their age, annual income, and spending score. Customer segmentation aims to identify distinct groups of customers with similar characteristics and behaviors. Understanding these segments can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to better meet the needs of each group.

Dataset:
The project uses a dataset that includes information about customers' age, annual income (in thousands of dollars), and spending score (ranging from 1 to 100). The data is structured with each customer assigned a label indicating the cluster they belong to.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: The project likely involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to gain insights into the distribution of variables, relationships between features, and the characteristics of different clusters.

Customer Segmentation: Various clustering algorithms are employed to segment customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score. Popular algorithms like K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN may be used.

Cluster Profiling: After segmentation, each cluster is analyzed to understand the characteristics and behavior of customers within that group. This profiling helps in naming and interpreting each cluster, as demonstrated in the previous responses.

Market Analysis: Using the insights gained from cluster profiling, a market analysis is conducted to understand the preferences, spending habits, and potential needs of each customer segment. This analysis guides businesses in tailoring their marketing strategies and product offerings accordingly.

Data Visualization: Visualizations like scatter plots, bar charts, and 3D plots (as seen in the previous response) are created to present the findings and make the results more understandable and actionable.

Conclusion and Recommendations: The project concludes by summarizing the findings, identifying key customer segments, and providing actionable recommendations for marketing and business strategies based on the analysis.
